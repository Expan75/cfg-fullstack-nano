We are going to solve one problem in 3 different ways to see how Time-Space complexity is affected.

TASK: Find first duplicate value
--------------------------------

Given an array of int between 1 and n, where n is the length of array, write a function that returns
the first int that appears more than once (when we read array left to right)
If no integer appears more than once, then we return -1.

Example 1
---------
input = [2,1,5,2,3,3,4]
output = 2

2 is the first integer that appears more than once. 3 also appears more than once, but
second 3 appears after second 2.


Example 2
---------
input = [2,1,5,3,3,2,4]
output = 3

3 is the first integer that appears more than once. 2 also appears more than once, but
second 2 appears after second 3.
